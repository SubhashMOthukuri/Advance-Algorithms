# Advanced Algorithms - Concordia University Wisconsin

## Course Overview
This repository contains learning materials and implementations for **Advanced Algorithms**, a high-level course focused on algorithmic problem-solving techniques and optimizations. The concepts covered include fundamental data structures, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, compression techniques, and blockchain algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Arrays and Linked Lists**
   - Array operations: Searching, sorting, and manipulation
   - Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
   - Circular Linked Lists
   - Applications and trade-offs of dynamic vs. static data structures

### 2. **Graph Algorithms**
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path in weighted graphs
   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handling negative weights
   - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest paths
   - Graph traversal: BFS & DFS

### 3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - **Memoization & Tabulation** techniques
   - **Knapsack Problem**: Optimizing resource allocation
   - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
   - **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Efficient matrix computation

### 4. **Huffman Coding and Compression**
   - Understanding **Huffman Trees**
   - Lossless data compression techniques
   - Implementation of Huffman Coding for text compression

### 5. **Blockchain Algorithms**
   - Hashing and Merkle Trees
   - Consensus algorithms: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)
   - Smart contracts and cryptographic security principles
